Libft
   This project is dedicated to coding the C library.
   It contains many general-purpose functions that the following programs will rely on.

Printf
  The purpose of this project is quite simple. recode printf().
  Basically learned about using a variable number of arguments.
  
Philosophers
  In this project, I studied the basics of process streaming.
  I learned how to create threads and use mutexes.
  
Cub3d
  This project is inspired by the world-famous 3D game Wolfenstein, which
  became the first FPS in history. This allowed me to investigate ray tracing. The goal was to
  create a dynamic view inside the maze in which you had to find your way.
  
Minishell
  This project is dedicated to creating a simple shell.
  Yes, my own little bush.
  I've learned a lot about processes and file descriptors.
